# build-a-email_scrapper
This repository contains a Python script that allows you to scrape email addresses from a specific website for penetration testing purposes.
The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML of the website and extract all email addresses that are present on the site. The script also follows all the links on the website and continues to scrape email addresses from all linked pages.

The script takes a single command-line argument, the URL of the website to scrape. Once the script completes, it will print out all the email addresses that it has found.

Please note that, scraping personal information without the individual's consent may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Use this script at your own risk and make sure to comply with all laws and regulations in your area.

Also, please respect the terms of service of the website you're scraping. If you're using this script for pentesting, please only use it against targets that you have permission to test.
